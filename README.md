# create-express-starter

`create-express-starter` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that helps you quickly set up a new Express.js project. It provides options to generate either a basic Express application or an advanced Express application with a more comprehensive structure, including API versioning, controllers, routes, schemas, and utilities.

## Features

- **Basic Express Setup**: A minimal Express.js application with essential configurations.
- **Advance Express Setup**: A more feature-rich Express.js application with a structured API, including:
  - API versioning (`/api/v1`)
  - Controllers, Routes, and Schemas
  - Utility functions (e.g., `api-response`, `try-catch`, `env`)
  - OpenAPI documentation setup
  - Drizzle ORM integration (schema and config)
- **Git Initialization**: Option to initialize a Git repository.
- **Dependency Installation**: Option to install project dependencies using your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun).

## Installation

To use `create-express-starter`, you can clone this repository and run the CLI directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HimanshuKumarDutt094/create-exress-starter.git
cd create-exress-starter
pnpm install # or npm install, yarn install, bun install
```

## Usage

To create a new Express project, run the CLI from the root of this repository:

```bash
pnpm ts-node src/index.ts
```

The CLI will prompt you for the following information:

1.  **Project Directory**: Where you would like to create your new project (e.g., `.` for the current directory, or a new directory name like `my-express-app`).
2.  **Express Setup Type**: Choose between "Basic Express Setup" and "Advance Express Setup".
3.  **Initialize Git Repository**: Confirm if you want to initialize a Git repository in your new project.
4.  **Install Dependencies**: Confirm if you want to install dependencies for your new project.

### Example

```bash
$ pnpm ts-node src/index.ts

? Where would you like to create your project? â€º my-express-app
? Which Express setup would you like? â€º Basic Express Setup
? Would you like to initialize a git repository? â€º Yes
? Would you like to install dependencies? â€º Yes

# ... CLI output for project creation, git init, and dependency installation ...

Project created successfully! ðŸŽ‰

Next steps:
  cd my-express-app
  pnpm run dev
```

## Project Structure (Advance Express Setup)

The "Advance Express Setup" provides a robust structure for scalable Express applications:

## Development

To develop `create-express-starter` itself:

```bash
pnpm dev # Starts TypeScript in watch mode
```

## Building

To build the CLI for distribution:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and copy the `templates` directory into the `dist` folder.
