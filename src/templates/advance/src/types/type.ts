 *  - Type protected controllers as `AuthedHandler<Params, ResBody, ReqBody, ReqQuery, Locals>`
 *  - In your route, wrap with `withRequiredAuth(controller)` to enforce auth at runtime
 *    and provide compile-time narrowing for `req.auth`.
 *
 * Common error and quick fix:
 *  - If you pass an `AuthedHandler` directly to `router.METHOD(...)` you may see an
 *    overload error because Express expects a plain `RequestHandler`.
 *  - Quick fix: wrap the handler â†’ `withRequiredAuth(yourController)`.
